# Effect of Monsoon on Groundwater Recharge

- Pre-monsoon water levels are lowest, typically measured in May–June.
- Significant recharge occurs during July–September due to rainfall.
- Post-monsoon water levels generally rise by 1–5 meters depending on local geology and rainfall.
- Areas with good aquifer permeability show faster recharge.
