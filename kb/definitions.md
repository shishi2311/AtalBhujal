# Key Groundwater Definitions

## Aquifer
An aquifer is a body of rock or unconsolidated material that stores and transmits groundwater. Types include unconfined and confined aquifers.

## Water Table
The water table is the surface where the pressure head is equal to atmospheric pressure. It rises in monsoon and declines in dry seasons.

## Pre-monsoon vs Post-monsoon
Pre-monsoon levels are typically measured around May–June; post-monsoon are measured around Oct–Nov.
